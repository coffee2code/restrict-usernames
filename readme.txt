Restrict the usernames that new users may use when registering for your site.


== Description ==

This plugin allows you to restrict the usernames that new users may use when registering for your site.

If open registration is enabled for your site (via Settings -> General -> Membership ("Anyone can register")), WordPress allows visitors to register for an account on your blog. By default, any username they choose is allowed so long as it isn't an already existing account and it doesn't include invalid (i.e. non-alphanumeric) characters.

Possible reasons for wanting to restrict certain usernames:

* Prevent usernames that contain foul, offensive, or otherwise undesired words
* Prevent squatting on usernames that you may want to use in the future (but don't want to actually create the account for just yet) (essentially placing a hold on the username)
* Prevent official-sounding usernames from being used (i.e. help, support, pr, info, sales)
* Prevent official username syntax from being used (i.e. if all of your administrators use a prefix to identify themselves, you don't want a visitor to use that prefix)
* Prevent spaces from being used in a username (which WordPress allows by default)
* Require that a username starts with, ends with, or contain one of a set of substrings (i.e. "support_", "admin_")
* Require a minimum number of characters for usernames
* Limit usernames to a maximum number of characters

When attempting to register with a restricted username, the visitor will be given an error notice that says:
ERROR: This username is invalid. Please enter a valid username.

NOTE: This plugin does not put any restrictions on usernames that the admin chooses for users when creating user accounts from within the WordPress admin. This only restricts the names that users choose themselves when registering for your site.

Compatible with Multisite and BuddyPress as well.

== Installation ==

1. Whether installing or updating, whether this plugin or any other, it is always advisable to back-up your data before starting
1. Unzip `restrict-usernames.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress. In Multisite, Network Activate the plugin.
1. Go to the Users -> Name Restrictions admin settings page (which you can also get to via the Settings link next to the plugin on the Manage Plugins page) and specify username restrictions. On a Multisite install, go to My Sites -> Network Admin -> Users -> Name Restrictions.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= So if I restrict a username from being registered, does that mean that username can't be used at all? =

No. The plugin only prevents the usernames visitors can use when registering for an account. An admin that has user creation privileges can still create a user account, from within the admin, using any otherwise valid username. Username restrictions don't apply to admins.

= Does this plugin provide any default username restrictions? =

No.

= If I specify restricted usernames and a required username substring, must all criteria be matched by potential usernames?

Yes.

= What if I define username restrictions that some existing user accounts would violate? =

Nothing happens to those accounts. The plugin does not do anything with existing accounts. Existing usernames are not checked against any username restriction rules; that only happens for accounts being newly registered.

= Is this Multisite compatible? =

Yes.

= Is this BuddyPress compatible? =

Yes, for at least BuddyPress 1.2+ and 1.3+, and perhaps other versions.

= Does this plugin include unit tests? =

Yes.


== Screenshots ==

== Filters ==

The plugin exposes one filter for hooking. Typically, customizations utilizing this hook would be put into your active theme's functions.php file, or used by another plugin.

= c2c_restrict_usernames-validate (filter) =

The 'c2c_restrict_usernames-validate' hook allows you to add your own customized checks for the username being registered. You can add additional restrictions or override the assessment performed by the plugin.

Arguments:

* $valid (boolean): The assessment by the plugin about the validity of the username based on settings. True means username can be used.
* $username (string): The username being registered.
* $settings (array): The plugin's settings.

Example:

`
/**
 * Add custom checks on usernames.
 *
 * Specifically, prevent use of usernames ending in numbers.
 */
function my_restrict_usernames_check( $valid, $username, $options ) {
	// Only do additional checking if the plugin has already performed its
	// checks and deemed the username valid.
	if ( $valid ) {
		// Don't allow usernames to end in numbers.
		if ( preg_match( '/[0-9]+$/', $username ) )
			$valid = false;
	}
	return $valid;
}
add_filter( 'c2c_restrict_usernames-validate', 'my_restrict_usernames_check', 10, 3 );
