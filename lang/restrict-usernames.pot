"These are partial text values, one of which MUST appear in any username "

"sort of identifier in their username, like \"support_\" (leading to "
"\"support_john\") or \"admin_\" (\"admin_steve\"), etc.  A username needs to "
"only include ONE of the listed partials.  Prepend a partial with \"^\" (i.e. "
"\"^support_\" to require that partial as the start of a username) or end "
"with \"^\" to require that partial be at the end (i.e. \"_support^\").  "
"Without use of \"^\", the partial can appear in any position in the "
"username.  Be aware that this plugin does not convey to the user what these "
"requirements are, it only enforces the requirement.  Define one per line and "
"use all lowercase."
